# On A Mission To Mars
The purpose of this project was to combine Python, HTML and CSS, MongoDB and other skills to scrape information from the web, add it to and pull it from
a database and create a mobile-friendly website that displayed the information, with a few elements of CSS styling for good measure. The final product here
is optimized for viewing on the Iphone X, and uses CSS updates on the "Scrape" button and Mars Hemisphere thumbnails.
